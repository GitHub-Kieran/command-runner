## Desktop App Installation

### Linux

#### Option 1: Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
1. Download the latest `.deb` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/GitHub-Kieran/command-runner/releases) page
2. Install using your package manager: `sudo dpkg -i command-runner_*.deb`
3. If there are dependency issues, run: `sudo apt-get install -f`

#### Option 2: AppImage
1. Download the latest `.AppImage` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/GitHub-Kieran/command-runner/releases) page
2. Make the file executable: `chmod +x Command-Runner-*.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage: `./Command-Runner-*.AppImage` or right click and run

#### Option 3: Other Linux Distributions
For distributions not supporting .deb or AppImage:
```bash
cd src/CommandRunner.ReactWebsite
npm run build-electron-linux
```
### Windows

3. Launch the app from Applications

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- .NET 8.0 SDK (for API backend)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GitHub-Kieran/command-runner.git
   cd command-runner
   ```

2. **Start the API server** (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   cd src/CommandRunner.Api
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5081`

3. **Setup and start the frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd src/CommandRunner.ReactWebsite
   npm install
   npm run electron-dev
   ```

This will start both the Vite dev server and Electron app with hot reloading.

### Building for Production

```bash
cd src/CommandRunner.ReactWebsite

# Build for current platform
npm run build-electron

# Build for Linux only
npm run build-electron-linux

# Build for Windows only
npm run build-electron-win

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Try the .deb package instead of AppImage
- Run: `sudo apt-get install -f` to fix dependencies

**API connection errors:**
- Ensure the API server is running on port 5081
- Check firewall settings
- In development, start the API: `cd src/CommandRunner.Api && dotnet run`

**Build issues:**
- Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Permission issues:**
- On Linux: `chmod +x Command-Runner-*.AppImage`
- On Windows: Run as administrator if needed
